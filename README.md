### Go Lang Learning

Is there is a lang like C/C++ which has high performance ?
Is there is a lang like Java which has a Garbage Collection period ?
Is there is a lang like Python which is easy to learning, but it has a static type check,
function programming, concurrent programming?

Now, Go is ready to solve problem above.

### CSP (Communication Sequential Process)
you don't worry about the LOCK/CallBack, It was solve by sub system 
the `NODE` will calculate concurrently

### compile
go build
go run

it will compile into machine code, faster

### fmt library
this format library

like C, `printf("this is a int %d", 100)`, in Go, `fmt.Printf(this is a int %d", 100)`, see

### net library
`import (
 	"net/http"
 )`
 
 
 ### Node
 the Go file name rule I do not know yet
